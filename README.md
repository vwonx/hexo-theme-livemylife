> Thanks to [Vincent](https://v-vincen.github.io/) for providing the excellent LiveMyLife theme
> In the branch of this repo, I made some changes to make this theme work for me.

In details, I made the following changes:

1. Update all node-js dependencies used in this theme.

2. Add 'email_address' field to the _config.yml to add SNS options

3. Add 'post-img' field to the _config.yml to set the default header image for posts.

4. Add 'comments' field in the _config.yml to control the comments plugin.

5. Add hexo-abbrlink plugin.

6. Fixed an issue where 'mouseclick' could not be disabled.
